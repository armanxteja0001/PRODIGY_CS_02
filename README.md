# PRODIGY_CS_02
Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption
# 🖼️ Task 02 – Pixel-Based Image Encryption

## 📌 Internship: Prodigy InfoTech – Cyber Security

This project is a basic **image encryption/decryption tool** that works by inverting the RGB pixel values using Python's Pillow library.

---

## 🧠 Concept

Each pixel’s Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) value is **inverted**:
Encrypted Pixel = (255 - R, 255 - G, 255 - B)
Reapplying the same operation **decrypts** the image.

---

## 📂 Features

- Simple encryption & decryption using pixel manipulation
- Easy-to-use command line interface
- Based on **open-source libraries** (Pillow)

---

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Install Pillow:
```bash
pip install pillow
Add an image named input.jpg in the folder

Run:
python image_encryption.py

Encrypted output will be saved as encrypted.png
Decrypted output as decrypted.png
